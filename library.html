	    				<span class="title">Banana Spider</span>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Size and Color:</strong> This spider is named for the pattern of white and yellow spots on the abdomen that form a cross in most specimens. Usually about 1/2”- 1 1/2" in body length, the largest non-tarantula spider in North America.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> These are generally non-aggressive spiders that if bitten will form a swollen welt that typically only lasts a few days.  Their webs average 2+ feet in diameter and are typically very complex in design and very strong.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> They inhabit forest areas along trails and clearing edges.   Typically found in the open between two trees that are within 6ft apart.</span><br>

	    				<span class="title">Brown Recluse</span>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Size and Color:</strong> Adults are usually about 1/4” - 1/2” in body length. They are tan to dark brown, usually with a darker marking abdomen.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The recluse spider is one of the most poisonous spiders.  The recluse’s venom is a necrotic toxin that attacks the skin and muscle tissue surrounding the injection site. The bite will gradually go through stages of intense pain and swelling. Gradually, ulcers and skin and muscle loss will occur.  Healing is very slow and usually takes several weeks resulting in scar tissue.  In severe cases, plastic surgery is necessary.  There is no current anti-venom available for this type of spider bite.  If bitten go to the emergency room immediately.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> These spiders are typically found around rocks, piles of woodpiles, under bark, etc. On the interior, they can be found in just about any undisturbed area. Common areas include: boxes, around papers, in seldom-used clothing and shoes, corners, under furniture, crevices found around baseboards, doors, and moldings.  With that said, storage areas may be a prime area for nesting due to infrequent usage. When disturbed these spiders will typically run away.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Size and Color:</strong> The size of the body is approximately 1/2” wide and 1 1/2” to 1 3/8” in length. Shiny black abdomen with red hourglass markings on the underside.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The female black widow spider is a poisonous spider. The black widow’s venom is a neurotoxin that attacks the nervous system and may cause pain and serious illness. Though the bite is not often felt, pain will develop immediately. Reactions to the black widow’s venom include increased body temperature and blood pressure, profuse sweating, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and pain and swelling around the bite. Antitoxin is available to combat the neurotoxin. If bitten, call a physician or go to an emergency room immediately. Bites are rarely fatal when promptly treated, however, small children are at greater risk.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Five different species of the black widow spider can be found in North America. They generally live under rocks and wooded areas. In and around the house they are often found in firewood piles, pool areas, basements and crawlspaces.  They are also found in places, such as garages, window wells and sheds. They feed on insects and other spiders. They are usually not aggressive spiders, but if handled or accidentally touched, they may bite.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> The retreat of a wolf spider is commonly found in a shallow excavation, under a stone, or a tube/burrow running vertically or diagonally into the ground. Web retreats are sometimes built when young are present. Outside, it is common to find these spiders in and around wood piles, under decks, in window wells, in leaf litter, around landscape features, etc. If found inside, wolf spiders have usually entered in search of prey. Inside, they tend to stay at or near floor level, especially along walls, under furniture, and other objects.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Appears glossy and carries a reddish-brown look throughout the body. Even the wings are the same color and darker brown marks can be seen at the center of the shoulders. The female has a shorter pair of wings while the male’s wings extend past his abdomen. This makes them appear longer.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Adults eat moist foods. This can be human and pet foods or organic matter.  Because they eat the same foods as humans and pets, they are considered a huge commercial and personal pest problem.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>Females lay about a dozen eggs at a time and then carry them on their backs for a few days, unloading them in a dark area where the eggs can hatch undisturbed.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> In buildings, these cockroaches inhabit high moisture areas such as sewers, drains and dark, damp basements. Their activities are somewhat restricted to the ground or below-ground levels of buildings.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Adult oriental cockroaches are glossy dark brown to black. Females may be nearly 1 1/4 inches long, while males are 1 inch long. The male’s wings cover most of the body, while the female’s shorter wings are reduced to mere lobes. Neither sex can fly, and in fact, these cockroaches are rather sluggish and do not move very fast even when disturbed. Nymphal cockroaches are smaller than adults, dark brown to black, and have wing stubs without definite veins</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> They feed on all kinds of filth, rubbish, and other decaying organic matter. They seem especially fond of garbage and the contents of discarded tin cans. If water is available, they can live for a month without food; without water they die within two weeks.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>The adult female oriental cockroach usually carries her egg capsule for about a day, then drops it or attaches it to a protected surface near a food supply. These cockroaches appear to have a seasonal cycle in their development. They overwinter as large nymphs or adults, and are usually noticed in the spring when they mate.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> In the spring of the year, they migrate from buildings to the out of doors where they spend the summer months. In the fall, the next generation tries to find shelter indoors where they can spend the winter. Natural mortality usually reduces the number of adults in the population during the summer, fall and winter.</span><br>	    				<input type="radio" name="product" value="mobile">

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Prefer to eat decaying organic matter and are attracted to light, whereas most roaches run from light.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>Females deposit their egg capsules outdoors under old logs, stumps and firewood. There is one generation of Wood cockroaches per year and, in some cases, the life cycle takes two years.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> At dusk, Wood cockroach males may begin taking short flights and are drawn to porch or house lights. The Wood cockroach normal habitat is moist woodland areas but it frequently become a household nuisance because it wanders into or is carried into the house with firewood. Wood roach, do not survive indoors. They require the consistently moist environment of their natural habitats such as under woodpiles or loose bark and in decaying logs.</span><br>

Both adults and nymphs can be distinguished by the broad bands across the body at the base of the abdomen and the mid=abdomen. </span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> They may consume materials like glue or paste (especially from animal-based materials), starch, and certain color dyes. As a result, items like stamps, envelopes, bindings of older books, draperies, and occasionally wallpapers may show signs of feeding. This species has also been known to chew on nonfood materials, such as nylon stockings, presumably for the residues of body oils and skin flakes.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>Eggs are laid in capsules, which the female carries for about 30 hours before she fastens it on walls, ceilings, and in protected and hidden areas. During her adult life a female produces about 14 egg capsules, each containing an average of 13 eggs. The length of the egg stage varies from 37 to 103 days, depending on temperature. The nymphal stage ranges from 8 to 31 weeks. A female adult has a life span of 13 to 45 weeks; each female produces about 600 descendants per year.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> They feed on all kinds of filth, rubbish, and other decaying organic matter. They seem especially fond of garbage and the contents of discarded tin cans. If water is available, they can live for a month without food; without water they die within two weeks.</span><br>
