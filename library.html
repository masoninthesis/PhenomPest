	    				<span class="title">Banana Spider</span>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Size and Color:</strong> This spider is named for the pattern of white and yellow spots on the abdomen that form a cross in most specimens. Usually about 1/2”- 1 1/2" in body length, the largest non-tarantula spider in North America.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> These are generally non-aggressive spiders that if bitten will form a swollen welt that typically only lasts a few days.  Their webs average 2+ feet in diameter and are typically very complex in design and very strong.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> They inhabit forest areas along trails and clearing edges.   Typically found in the open between two trees that are within 6ft apart.</span><br>

	    				<span class="title">Brown Recluse</span>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Size and Color:</strong> Adults are usually about 1/4” - 1/2” in body length. They are tan to dark brown, usually with a darker marking abdomen.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The recluse spider is one of the most poisonous spiders.  The recluse’s venom is a necrotic toxin that attacks the skin and muscle tissue surrounding the injection site. The bite will gradually go through stages of intense pain and swelling. Gradually, ulcers and skin and muscle loss will occur.  Healing is very slow and usually takes several weeks resulting in scar tissue.  In severe cases, plastic surgery is necessary.  There is no current anti-venom available for this type of spider bite.  If bitten go to the emergency room immediately.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> These spiders are typically found around rocks, piles of woodpiles, under bark, etc. On the interior, they can be found in just about any undisturbed area. Common areas include: boxes, around papers, in seldom-used clothing and shoes, corners, under furniture, crevices found around baseboards, doors, and moldings.  With that said, storage areas may be a prime area for nesting due to infrequent usage. When disturbed these spiders will typically run away.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Size and Color:</strong> The size of the body is approximately 1/2” wide and 1 1/2” to 1 3/8” in length. Shiny black abdomen with red hourglass markings on the underside.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The female black widow spider is a poisonous spider. The black widow’s venom is a neurotoxin that attacks the nervous system and may cause pain and serious illness. Though the bite is not often felt, pain will develop immediately. Reactions to the black widow’s venom include increased body temperature and blood pressure, profuse sweating, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, and pain and swelling around the bite. Antitoxin is available to combat the neurotoxin. If bitten, call a physician or go to an emergency room immediately. Bites are rarely fatal when promptly treated, however, small children are at greater risk.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Five different species of the black widow spider can be found in North America. They generally live under rocks and wooded areas. In and around the house they are often found in firewood piles, pool areas, basements and crawlspaces.  They are also found in places, such as garages, window wells and sheds. They feed on insects and other spiders. They are usually not aggressive spiders, but if handled or accidentally touched, they may bite.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> The retreat of a wolf spider is commonly found in a shallow excavation, under a stone, or a tube/burrow running vertically or diagonally into the ground. Web retreats are sometimes built when young are present. Outside, it is common to find these spiders in and around wood piles, under decks, in window wells, in leaf litter, around landscape features, etc. If found inside, wolf spiders have usually entered in search of prey. Inside, they tend to stay at or near floor level, especially along walls, under furniture, and other objects.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Appears glossy and carries a reddish-brown look throughout the body. Even the wings are the same color and darker brown marks can be seen at the center of the shoulders. The female has a shorter pair of wings while the male’s wings extend past his abdomen. This makes them appear longer.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Adults eat moist foods. This can be human and pet foods or organic matter.  Because they eat the same foods as humans and pets, they are considered a huge commercial and personal pest problem.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>Females lay about a dozen eggs at a time and then carry them on their backs for a few days, unloading them in a dark area where the eggs can hatch undisturbed.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> In buildings, these cockroaches inhabit high moisture areas such as sewers, drains and dark, damp basements. Their activities are somewhat restricted to the ground or below-ground levels of buildings.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Adult oriental cockroaches are glossy dark brown to black. Females may be nearly 1 1/4 inches long, while males are 1 inch long. The male’s wings cover most of the body, while the female’s shorter wings are reduced to mere lobes. Neither sex can fly, and in fact, these cockroaches are rather sluggish and do not move very fast even when disturbed. Nymphal cockroaches are smaller than adults, dark brown to black, and have wing stubs without definite veins</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> They feed on all kinds of filth, rubbish, and other decaying organic matter. They seem especially fond of garbage and the contents of discarded tin cans. If water is available, they can live for a month without food; without water they die within two weeks.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>The adult female oriental cockroach usually carries her egg capsule for about a day, then drops it or attaches it to a protected surface near a food supply. These cockroaches appear to have a seasonal cycle in their development. They overwinter as large nymphs or adults, and are usually noticed in the spring when they mate.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> In the spring of the year, they migrate from buildings to the out of doors where they spend the summer months. In the fall, the next generation tries to find shelter indoors where they can spend the winter. Natural mortality usually reduces the number of adults in the population during the summer, fall and winter.</span><br>	    				<input type="radio" name="product" value="mobile">

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Prefer to eat decaying organic matter and are attracted to light, whereas most roaches run from light.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>Females deposit their egg capsules outdoors under old logs, stumps and firewood. There is one generation of Wood cockroaches per year and, in some cases, the life cycle takes two years.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> At dusk, Wood cockroach males may begin taking short flights and are drawn to porch or house lights. The Wood cockroach normal habitat is moist woodland areas but it frequently become a household nuisance because it wanders into or is carried into the house with firewood. Wood roach, do not survive indoors. They require the consistently moist environment of their natural habitats such as under woodpiles or loose bark and in decaying logs.</span><br>

Both adults and nymphs can be distinguished by the broad bands across the body at the base of the abdomen and the mid=abdomen. </span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> They may consume materials like glue or paste (especially from animal-based materials), starch, and certain color dyes. As a result, items like stamps, envelopes, bindings of older books, draperies, and occasionally wallpapers may show signs of feeding. This species has also been known to chew on nonfood materials, such as nylon stockings, presumably for the residues of body oils and skin flakes.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction: </strong>Eggs are laid in capsules, which the female carries for about 30 hours before she fastens it on walls, ceilings, and in protected and hidden areas. During her adult life a female produces about 14 egg capsules, each containing an average of 13 eggs. The length of the egg stage varies from 37 to 103 days, depending on temperature. The nymphal stage ranges from 8 to 31 weeks. A female adult has a life span of 13 to 45 weeks; each female produces about 600 descendants per year.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> They feed on all kinds of filth, rubbish, and other decaying organic matter. They seem especially fond of garbage and the contents of discarded tin cans. If water is available, they can live for a month without food; without water they die within two weeks.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Appearance:</strong> Carpenter ants are usually reddish black in color and 5/8 inch in size.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Region:</strong> This species is located throughout the United States, but is most common in cool, damp climates found in the northern part of the country.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Carpenter ants build their nests outdoors in various wood sources and frequently enter buildings through damaged wood, cracks around doors and windows, or holes in a structure meant for wires. They will also crawl along shrubs or tree limbs that touch a structure far above the ground.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Threat:</strong> Carpenter ants can cause severe property damage as they tunnel through wood to build nests. However, the extent and cost the damage usually depends on the number of nests inside the structure and how long they've been active.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Appearance:</strong> Caribbean crazy ants get their common name from the worker's habit of running in an erratic, jerky manner when searching for food. Crazy ants are dark brown to black in color with a gray sheen. They range from 1/16-1/8 inch in size.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Region:</strong> Crazy ants are found throughout the United States as this species is highly adaptable to both dry and moist habitats.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Habitat:</strong> Crazy ants tend to enter homes in the autumn or after rainfall because both conditions reduce the supply of honeydew – their main food source. Inside, these ants usually nest underneath floors or carpeting. Outdoors, the nests are shallow and commonly found in soil under objects or next to foundations.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Threat:</strong> These ants do not pose a health threat, but if they gain entry to a structure, they can become a nuisance.</span><br>

	    				<span class="title">House Mouse</span>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> House mice are from 65 to 95 mm long from the tip of their nose to the end of their body, their tails are 60 to 105 mm long. Their fur ranges in color from light brown to black, and they generally have white or buffy bellys. They have long tails that have very little fur and have circular rows of scales. House mice tend to have longer tails and darker fur when living closely with humans. They range from 12 to 30 g in weight.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> In the wild, house mice eat many kinds of plant matter, including seeds, roots, leaves, and stems. They will also eat insects (beetles, caterpillars, and cockroaches) and meat if it is available. If house mice live near humans, they will eat any human food that is available as well as glue, soap, and other household materials. Many mice will gather and then store their food for later use.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> House mice are able to reproduce throughout the year, often having 5-10 litters each year when conditions are favorable. Pregnancy lasts for 19 to 21 days and 5 to 6 young are born per litter, though there can be as many as 12. Young weigh about 1 gram at birth and are naked, blind, and helpless. At 10 days old they have fur and at 14 days old they open their eyes. The young are nursed for 21 days and reach adulthood at 5 to 7 weeks old.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> House mice generally live close to humans, in places like houses and barns. Some individuals spend the summer in fields and move into barns and houses with the onset of cool autumn weather. Because house mice take advantage of human shelters and food, they have been able to live in areas like deserts where, without humans, they would not be able to live.  In the wild, house mice generally live in cracks in rocks or in walls or make underground tunnels. Their homes usually have several "rooms" for nesting and storage, and three or four exits. When living with humans, house mice nest in roofs, in woodpiles, storage areas, or any hidden spot near a source of food. They make their nests from rags, paper, or other soft substances. House mice are generally most active at night, although some are active during the day. House mice are quick runners (up to 8 miles per hour), good climbers, jumpers, and also swim well. Despite this, they rarely travel far from their home.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Round and slender, ranging from 7 to 10 cm long in body length with a pointed nose and large, black beady eyes; ears are large with little fur covering them. Body is bicolored with a light brownish-reddish top and white underbelly and feet. Tail is short, distinctly bicolored (dark on top and light on bottom), and covered with short, fine hairs and can be 5 to 13 cm in length.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Deer mice are primarily herbivorous, but will also consume other things. They prefer seeds, nuts, small fruits and berries, insects.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Reaches sexual maturity in about 7 to 8 weeks. Will produce two to four litters a year, usually during warm months. Typical litters contain three to five individuals, but may have as many as eight. Typically live two to 24 months, but can live as long as eight years in captivity.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> Nests within hollow logs, tree holes, under piles of stones or logs. Most commonly associated with prairies or other rural, bushy or wooded areas. Avoids humans if indoors, preferring attics, basements or crawl spaces. In winter, deer mice enter domestic spaces in search of food and warmth. Their nests are constructed of fur, weeds, seed and paper. Although they become sluggish during cold months, deer mice do not hibernate.</span><br>
						<span class="description"><strong>Caution:</strong> Deer mice may appear harmless, but they are known carriers of dangerous diseases such as hantavirus. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can develop from inhaling the virus when deer mouse urine or feces is disturbed. Utmost care should be employed when disposing of deer mouse droppings. The droppings and urine should be sprayed with disinfectant before sweeping them up.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Norway rats have lengths from nose to tip of tail of about 15.7inches while the tail itself is 7.3inches. Norway rats have coarse-fur, large furless ears, and a scaly tail. Norway rats tend to be brown or dark gray with scattered black hairs, while their bellies are pale gray or grayish brown.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Norway rats are true omnivores. Norway rats eat a huge variety of foods including everything from soap to candy, milk, meat, vegetables, poultry, eggs and all grains, nuts and fruits. Norway rats are also very big eaters. They can eat a third of their weight in a day. Norway rats are capable of catching fish and small rodents, such as mice, and they readily eat dead animals. In cities, Norway rats enjoy human food that is uneaten or spoiled.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> If there is enough food and shelter Norway Rats will breed throughout the year, although more births occur in spring and autumn. Females can have between 1 and 12 litters each year, though they usually have 6 to 8 litters each year. Females are pregnant for 21 to 26 days. Each litter usually contains 7 babies but some litters can have between 2 and 22 young! The young are born blind, naked, and helpless at birth; the eyes open in 14 to 17 days, and the young are weaned when 3 weeks old. Sexual maturity is reached at 3 months.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> Norway rats probably originally lived in forested habitats. They are now found almost exclusively in areas near human settlements. They live wherever there is an abundance of food and shelter, from the subways and crowded buildings of cities, to the corn and grain fields of farm country, to the salt marshes of the Atlantic Coast.  Norway rats are active year-round and are mostly nocturnal, only leaving their homes as night approaches. Norway rats are shy and will hide or run away if a human approaches. Norway rats generally travel on the ground, but they are also good swimmers, jumpers, and climbers. Norway rats are usually found living together in large groups with the biggest male as the leader.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Camel crickets have an unusual humpbacked appearance with heads that are bent downward between their front legs.  Their antennae are much longer than their bodies and their large hind legs make them very strong jumpers.  Adults do not have wings and range in size from ½ to 1 ½ inches in length. Most species are light tan to dark brown in color.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Insects that are mostly dead already such as carpenter bees, spiders, etc.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Camel crickets spend the winter as either immatures or adults.  In the spring, females lay eggs in the soil and they hatch in a few weeks.  In greenhouses and other warm locations, camel crickets may breed year round.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> Most of the crickets in this group are active at night and are attracted to areas with high humidity and moisture. Outdoors camel crickets and their cave cricket cousins are found in wood and stone piles, tall grass and weeds, hollows of trees, holes in the ground, and of course, caves. If found indoors, camel crickets often will be in damp basements, crawl spaces, or garages. When conditions are dry, camel crickets may be found in unusual places as they seek moister locations. Under such conditions, they may be found in the living areas of buildings, especially laundry rooms and bathrooms where humidity is higher.</span><br>

	    				<span class="title">Stink Bugs</span>
	    				<span class="description">Also known as the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB).  The adults are approximately 1.7 centimetres (0.67 in) long and about as wide, forming the "shield" shape characteristic of other stink bugs. They are various shades of brown on both the top and undersides, with gray, off-white, black, copper, and bluish markings.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">The brown marmorated stinkbug is more likely to invade homes in the. The bug survives the winter as an adult by entering houses and structures when autumn evenings become colder, often in the thousands.  Adults can live from several months to a year.  They will enter under siding, around windows and doorframes, chimneys, or any space, which has openings big enough to fit through. Once inside the house, they will go into a state of hibernation. They wait for winter to pass, but often the warmth inside the house causes them to become active, and they may fly clumsily around light fixtures.<br>
	    				<span class="description">The odor from the stinkbug is due to trans-2-decenal and trans-2-Octenal. The smell has been characterized as a pungent odor that smells like cilantro.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">The stinkbug's ability to emit an odor through holes in its abdomen is a defense mechanism meant to prevent it from being eaten by birds and lizards. However, simply handling the bug, injuring it, or attempting to move it can trigger it to release the odor.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Control:</strong> Control of stink bugs is a priority of the Department of Agriculture which has developed an artificial pheromone which can be used to bait traps.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description">Bedbugs are small, oval, brownish insects that live on the blood of animals or humans. Adult bedbugs have flat bodies about the size of an apple seed. After feeding, however, their bodies swell and are a reddish color.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">Bedbugs do not fly, but they can move quickly over floors, walls, and ceilings. Female bedbugs may lay hundreds of eggs, each of which is about the size of a speck of dust, over a lifetime.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">Immature bedbugs, called nymphs, shed their skins five times before reaching maturity and require a meal of blood before each shedding. Under favorable conditions the bugs can develop fully in as little as a month and produce three or more generations per year.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">Bedbugs are active mainly at night and usually bite people while they are sleeping. They feed by piercing the skin and withdrawing blood through an elongated beak. The bugs feed from three to 10 minutes to become engorged and then crawl away unnoticed.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">Most bedbug bites are painless at first, but later turn into itchy welts. Unlike flea bites that are mainly around the ankles, bedbug bites are on any area of skin exposed while sleeping. Also, the bites do not have a red spot in the center like flea bites do.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Signs of infestation:</strong></span><br>
	    				<ul>
		    				<li>Blood stains on your sheets or pillowcases</li>
		    				<li>Dark or rusty spots of bedbug excrement on sheets and mattresses, bed clothes, or walls</li>

	    				<span class="title">Chinch Bugs</span>
	    				<span class="description">They are often associated with open, sunny areas and may be as numerous as 150 to 200 insects per square foot. Chinch bug populations frequently go unnoticed because of their small size and coloration, which blends in with turf grass and thatch. Chinch bug damage may be masked during periods of drought.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> An adult hairy chinch bug is about 1/6 inch long, has a gray-black body with fine hairs, white wings, and reddish legs. The outer margin of each forewing has a small, black, triangular spot. The wings of the adult are folded flat over their backs. Some populations of chinch bugs have adults with short wings. Young nymphs are about half the size of a pinhead, and start out as being brick-red with a transverse white band across the back. As the young mature, they turn gray and then black with wing pads developing as they mature into adults.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Two generations typically occur each year, and a partial third generation occurs during years with long summers. Adults usually remain in their overwintering sites until spring temperatures reach 50°F. Then adults begin to disperse, mate, and start laying eggs. Egg laying continues throughout their adult life. An adult female may produce an average of 300 eggs over 40 to 50 days. The eggs are deposited in leaf sheaths and in the ground on roots of host plants. The eggs hatch in 1 to 2 weeks, and the nymphs complete a series of five molts before maturing into adults over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. The new adults lay eggs from mid-July through late August. Second-generation nymphs hatch from the eggs and complete development from September through October. When the cool weather arrives, adults seek overwintering sites.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> Chinch bug infestations frequently occur in turf-grass with thick thatch that is exposed to full sunlight during periods of hot, dry weather. Chinch bug damage is often less noticeable during the spring and early summer. Damage frequently appears from early July through late August when the insects are actively feeding. Chinch bug nymphs and adults cause significant feeding damage by removing plant fluids and by injecting a toxin that causes the grass to yellow, turn reddish brown, and eventually die. Chinch bug damaged areas often coalesce into large patches of dead, brown grass.</span><br>

	    				<span class="title">Earwigs</span>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Depending on the species, adults range in size from 5-25 mm. They are slender insects with two pair of wings.  Some species produce a foul smelling liquid that they use for defense. Earwigs also produce a pheromone (scent). Scientists believe that this pheromone is the reason that earwigs cluster together in large numbers. Immature earwigs (nymphs) resemble the adults except they do not have wings.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Earwigs eat plants and insects.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Females typically lay between 30 and 50 but actual numbers depend on species.  After hatching, the nymphs undergo four to five molts until they become adults.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> Earwigs are active at night. During the day they hide in cracks in damp areas. They live under rocks and logs and in mulch in flowerbeds. Homeowners often find them in areas where there is water – kitchens, bathrooms, and laundries. Earwigs can also find their way into bedrooms and family rooms. They turn up in almost every part of the house.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">Outdoors, earwigs spend the winter in small burrows in the ground. In spring the female lays eggs in the burrow. She tends the eggs until they hatch. Then she cares for the nymphs until they can find their own food.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description">Earwigs are attracted to lights.  They can become a nuisance on porches and patios on summer evenings. In the morning they will be gathered under things like cushions that were left outside overnight. Earwigs move into homes to find food or because of a change in weather.</span><br>

	    				<span class="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Always wingless and are silvery to brown in color because their bodies are covered with fine scales. They are generally soft bodied. Adults are up to 3/4 inch long, flattened from top to bottom, elongated and oval in shape, have three long tail projections and two long antennae.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Food:</strong> Silverfish are chewing insects and general feeders but prefer carbohydrates and protein, including flour, dried meat, rolled oats, paper and even glue. They and can survive long periods, sometimes over a year, without food but are sensitive to moisture and require a high humidity (75% to 90%) to survive. They also have a temperature preference between 70 and 80 degrees F.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Females lay eggs continuously after reaching the adult stage and may lay over 100 eggs during her life. Eggs are deposited singly or in small groups in cracks and crevices and hatch in 3 to weeks. Silverfish develop from egg to young to adult within 4 to 6 weeks and continue to molt throughout their life. Immature stages appear similar to adults except they are about 1/20 of an inch long when they first hatch and whitish in color, taking on the adults’ silver coloring as they grow. They are long-lived, surviving from two to eight years.</span><br>
	    				<span class="description"><strong>Location:</strong> They are fast running and mostly active at night and generally prefer lower levels in basements and bathrooms of homes, but may be found in attics. They are sensitive to moisture and require a high humidity (75% to 90%) to survive. They also have a temperature preference between 70 and 80 degrees F.</span><br>
